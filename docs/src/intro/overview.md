# Overview of HSP

HSP is designed to be both user- and developer-friendly, aiming to create a cohesive code ecosystem that simplifies the complexities often encountered in computational research. Key features of HSP include:

- **Integration & Interface**
  - Universal support through seamless integration with various molecular and extended-system software
  - Unified syntax simplifies interaction, thus making specialized knowledge of individual softwares redundant
  - Codes can easily run in different environments: either as local programs, through Conda, Docker/Singularity, or by off-loading calculations to other machines through their queuing system
  - HPC integrated computational workflows, ranging from daily tools to complex setups

- **Platform functionality**
  - Efficient data management, streamlining parallel computations and data handling (with Pandas integration)
  - Visualization of structures, orbitals, densities, normal modes and trajectories
  - Simplified machine learning integration (DeepMD and Nequip)
  - Active-learning framework for automated machine-learning potential (MLP) generation
  - Geometry optimization and reaction pathway support

- **Development & Sustainability**
  - Robust infrastructure built on Python and Jupyter, ensuring thorough testing, code review, and version control.
  - Sustainable practices that encourage collaboration and sustainable development and platform longevity
  - AO tools to for instance transform integrals and operators between your favorite quantum chemistry codes

- **Education & Training**
  - Accessible learning through Jupyter notebooks

In this documentation we will provide detailed information about these features, both with text and
Jupyter notebook examples. We aim to provide users and developers with the building blocks
needed to take full advantage of the HSP in their daily activities. If you feel anything is missing, or can
be clarified, please do not hesitate to contact us [link].
