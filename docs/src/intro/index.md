> **Nomenclature**
>
> - **workflow**: set of jobs with optional dependencies, represented by `hyrun.job.JobGraph` class
> - **job**: set of ordered tasks that can be run using a script, e.g. on a cluster, represented by `hyrun.job.Job` class
> - **task**: a single calculation or more general procedure that can be represented by `hyset.RunSettings`
> - **result**: set of ordered outputs from a job, represented by a list.
> - **output**: outputs from a job, represented by `hyrun.result.Result` class.

the `hyrun` module offers the following methods:

1. `init()`: creating a workflow
1. `run()` : running a workflow
2. `check()` : checking on a workflow
4. `fetch()` : fetch results from a workflow
3. `update()` : combines `check()` and `fetch()`
4. `stop()` : stops /  cancels a workflow

All methods accept as input a workflow, a (list of) job(s), a (list of) task(s),
a (list of) result(s), a (list of) output(s) or combination of that.
As a first step, a workflow will be created.


--



all take the same input:

JobGraph
path to JobGraph
runsettings
list of run_settings
result dict object
list of result objects
list of run_settings and result objects

kwargs: logger

steps:

1. if path, load graph
2. if graph, return it
3. else: generate graph of ( generate list of Jobs (generate hash))

4. save original order
5. take topological order
6. group order by number of ancestors
7. subgroup by hosts
loop over groups
loop over subgroups
combine data to be send
establish connection







<!-- # Introduction

The [Hylleraas Software Platform](<https://gitlab.com/hylleraasplatform/hylleraas>)
(HSP) represents an active and evolving project aimed at bolstering the diverse spectrum of research endeavors undertaken within the [Hylleraas Centre](<https://www.mn.uio.no/hylleraas/english/>). With an emphasis on facilitating seamless integration among various software development and computational initiatives, HSP aspires to enable sophisticated multi-scale simulations that extend across a vast range of length and time scalesâ€”from single atoms to billions, and from attoseconds to milliseconds.

Beyond its primary mission, HSP endeavors to make a meaningful contribution to the broader scientific community. This is achieved by fostering a sustainable, flexible, and user-friendly platform that will continue to serve users and developers well beyond the lifespan of the Hylleraas Centre itself. Embracing an open-source philosophy, the platform is freely accessible to all interested parties.

We encourage contributions from those who find value in this project. Whether through direct code contributions, suggestions for improvements, or sharing insights that could benefit others, your involvement is warmly welcomed. While formal contribution guidelines are in development, we are ready to share our general guidelines upon request.
