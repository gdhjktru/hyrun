# ComputeSettings

A `ComputeSettings` class contains information about the computational environment. It is generated by `create_compute_settings()` and takes various keyword arguments.

```python
myenv = create_compute_settings('local',
                                work_dir = pathlib.Path('/home/user'),
                                scratch_dir = '/scr/user,
                                path=['/', '/usr/bin'],
                                lib='/usr/lib64',
                                env_vars = {'MY_ENV_VAR' : 'something'})
```

These settings will be via a Method instance parsed to the interface which performs the computations using the corresponding environmental variables.
The default constructor will return a local environment where all computations are performed within the current work directory.
